# QHE-Calcs Project - By Cyril Omar & Hosain Zbeidat

# Description
This project is an innovated Python platform, that can be used to research quantum heat engines in various capacities. For any given quantum system where
temperature dependence is known, this program approximates fairly accurately a large number (depending on potential and specifications) of energy levels.
From there the code calculates the quantum heat engine's efficiency and compares it to Carnot's efficiency under the same circumstances. The program
contains an example test section where it compares energy levels results with theoretical harmonic oscillator energy levels, feel free to change according
to your potential or completely delete.
This project was completed under the supervision of Prof. David Gelbwaser from the faculty of Chemistry, Technion IIT, Prof. Alon Grinberg-Dana from the
faculty of Chemical Engineering, Technion IIT, and Mr. Kfir Kaplan from the faculty of Chemical Engineering, Technion IIT.
The project was constructed under the Senior Thesis 1 Course of the Chemical Engineering Department of Technion IIT.
